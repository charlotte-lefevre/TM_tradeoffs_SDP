# TM_tradeoffs_SDP
Tools useful for time-memory tradeoffs for ternary syndrome decoding with large weight in the Wave regime.
This repository is composed of two main parts:
* **Cost_eval** aims at estimating the time and memory costs for different algorithms (k-tree, dissection, layered dissection & tweaks)
* **Implem_34_dissec** is a PoC of 4-dissection organized in a tree structure with 3 levels

# Requirements
* Sagemath (9.2)
* Python (3.9.2) + additional packages
* Jupyter-notebook (6.2.0)
